# Project Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to manage their gold calculation and management. It is built using Next.js and React. The whole content would be in Turkish.

## Folder Structure

- `/app/admin`: This for admin pages.
- `/app/dash`: This for regular user pages.
- `/lib`: Contains the codes that is used globally like zustand store and types, etc.
- `/components`: Contains reusable components including form components and UI elements.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
- Shadcn as the UI library - all of its components are in `/components/ui/*`
- React Hook Form with Zod for form validation
- TanStack Query for data fetching

## Coding Standards

- Use function-based components in React.
- Use `FetchData` from `/lib/fetchData.ts` whenever there is some fetching from backend.
- Use `useForm`, `zod`, `zodResolver` like in the login form for all forms.
- **Forms**: Always use `FormInput` component from `/components/FormInput.tsx` instead of raw `Input` components.
- **Boolean Controls**: Use `Switch` component from `/components/ui/switch.tsx` instead of checkboxes for boolean toggles.
- Form validation should use Zod schemas with proper error messages in Turkish.

## UI Guidelines

- Application should have a modern and clean design.
- The design must have one identity that all pages share common elements.
- All user-facing text must be in Turkish.
- Use consistent spacing and styling across pages.
- Forms should use the FormInput component for consistency and built-in validation display.
